### ABOUT ME:
I have a degree in Economics. It was always interesting for me to try something new, so I worked in different positions. I used to be an economist, a specialist in working with contracts, currently, I have been working in the field of purchasing.  Obviously,  I’m passionate about my future, so occasionally I thought about getting an education in IT. I'm very interested in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I’m looking forward to improving my experience, for I’m going to be a Frontend Developer. I assume, my soft skills, as flexibility, communication skills, teamwork, emotional intelligence, active listening, time management, and interpersonal skills will help me to achieve my goal. I have a happy disposition toward studying at RS School and improving my English with native speakers.
